  H tags can go from h1-h6 and appear in order of importance-->

  <b> What is <a href="https://youtu.be/5Kjx-NOwcSc">HTML</a></b>
  <!--Title of the first paragraph of notes with video linked into the HTML text-->
<p>HTML documents make up a majority of the online webpages that we see.<br>
The content of an HTML document is what you see on a webpage. <br>
The "ML" in HTML stands for Markup Language and it gives us the ability to edit<br>
the way that our web page looks by using relatively simple code to edit text placment,<br>
hyperlinks, embed pictures and video links etc.</p>
</div>
<div><b>HTML Tags and usage</b>
<p>In HTML, tags are used to define a body of text but also define how it is placed<br>
on the screen and how it behaves. For example, this paragraph is contained within<br>
a set of tags to define it as a paragraph of content and everything <br>
between the "p"open and "p"close tag is what you are reading now.</p>
<p2> Some examples of tags could be the "b" tag which would make the text<br>
inside of it <b>BOLD</b>.<br>
Or we could also use the "em" tag which would create italicised font,
<em>LIKE THIS</em>. </p2> </div>
<br><!--My previewer does not show equal spacing so I added these breakes to make
it look normal on my previewer. May not be needed.-->
<div><b>Computers are STOOPID</b>
<p>Human language is very articulate and free flowing. There are many ways<br>
to say the same thing and have many people understand. Computers do not work <br>
that way. Computer languages are fairly rigid in that they can only interpret inputs<br>
the way that they are expecting them. In other words, there is only one way to write any given command.
</p></div>
<div><b>Oh no! I forgot my <em>end tag</em></b>
<p>If you forget to add an end tag to a particular line, the tags function will continue<br>
to output that function until it is closed. So if I drop in a "b" tag and dont close it,<br>
<b>everything after that tag will remain bold</b>.</div>
<div><b>Lines and Blocks</b>
<br>
<p>Line tags and Block tags are used often and they are quite different.<br>
A line tag is something like a "br" tag that is simply used inside of a line of text.<br>
Whereas a "div" or "span" tag is used to control a block of text at the beginning and end.<br>
